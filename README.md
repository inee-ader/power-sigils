# Power Sigils

### README

## DESCRIPTION
Sigils are made by writing a phrase or intention down in a statement, and eliminating certain letters until the paramount letters remain. 

You write this statement in present-tense, and in a positive voice (ex: ~~Never doubt myself again~~ --> **I have self trust**). 

Then you eliminate all vowels. Then remove all consonants that repeat more than once, leaving the original consonant. 

**I have self trust** becomes **HVSLFTR**

Now you have one of each consonant and no vowels of your original statement. From here, you take out piece of paper and writing utensil and start drawing one single glyph that contains each letter. 

You can make this glyph more and more obscure, simplifying curves and lines into one beautiful shape. Once you feel satisfied with your sigil, you can engrave it somewhere, write it on something, carve it in a candle, or use it however you like to help you manifest that statement or set good intentions! 

This page is a tool to elimate the unnecessary letters, giving you the paramount characters to create your sigil!
